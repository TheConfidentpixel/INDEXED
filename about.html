          <h1>Hi, thanks for visiting my site.</h1>
          <p>Mining engineering is a field that involves the extraction and processing of minerals and other natural resources from the earth. It can be a challenging field to study, especially for students who did not have a background in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) subjects in high school.
          </p>
          <p>As a fourth year mining engineering student who has completed an internship in a nickel-laterite mining company and is preparing for a licensure exam, I have gained valuable experience and knowledge in the field. Join me as I relearn my lessons since freshmen years. I am gonna be studying starting from Introduction to Mining Engineering until Mine Planning and I am sharing it with you.</p>
